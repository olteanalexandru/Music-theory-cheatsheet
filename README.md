# Music-theory-cheatsheet

This project is designed to help musicians explore and understand various musical patterns, scales, and arpeggios on the bass guitar. The interactive interface allows users to visualize these patterns on a virtual fretboard and learn about their theoretical background.

## Features

- **Interactive Bass Fretboard**: Visualize notes, scales, and arpeggios on a bass guitar fretboard.
- **Pattern Selection**: Choose from a variety of scales and arpeggios to see their patterns on the fretboard.
- **Root Note Selection**: Select a root note to see how different patterns are constructed from that note.
- **Theory Information**: Toggle to show detailed theoretical information about the selected pattern.
- **Circle of Fifths**: Visual representation of the Circle of Fifths, showing key signatures and primary chords.

## Future Expansion

We plan to expand this project to include guitar theory as well. This will involve adding features such as:

- **Interactive Guitar Fretboard**: Similar to the bass fretboard, but tailored for guitar players.
- **Extended Pattern Library**: More scales, modes, and arpeggios specific to guitar.
- **Chord Diagrams**: Visual representations of common guitar chords and their fingerings.
- **Advanced Theory Lessons**: In-depth lessons on music theory concepts relevant to both guitar and bass.
